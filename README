JumpToWindow is a Rhythmbox plugin which shows a 'Jump to' window when a certain
hotkey is pressed. It allows to fast selecting a song from the currently playing
source (without having to use the mouse).
It's very similar to the 'Jump to File' feature in Winamp, including the ability
to enqueue a song.



Installation
------------

	1) Run make install
	   Or copy the content of this folder to the directory
	   "~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/JumpToWindow/"
	   (If this directory doesn't exist, create it!)

	2) Install a global hotkey that executes the script
	   "~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/JumpToWindow/src/activate.py"

	   - For gnome go to System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Add
	   - Or you can use the window manager independant package 'xbindkeys'
	     (http://www.nongnu.org/xbindkeys/xbindkeys.html)

	3) Enable the plugin in Rhythmbox under 'Edit > Plugins'

	4) You probably have to lower the focus prevention level in your window
	   manager, that the Jump to window gets the focus, when the hotkey is
	   pressed.
